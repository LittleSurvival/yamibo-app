# Repository Instructions

## OpenSpec isolation

- Never merge any file or change under `openspec/` into the `main` branch.
- Before merging into `main`, run `git diff --name-only main...HEAD -- openspec/` and require empty output.
- If a feature branch contains both implementation and `openspec/` changes, exclude the `openspec/` changes from the commits or history merged into `main`.
